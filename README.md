safe helmet is a smart safety system for two-wheeler riders that turns a helmet into an active hazard-detection device. It uses dual IMU data—from an Arduino Nicla Vision mounted on the helmet and a smartphone IMU—to detect falls and sudden jerks in real time and classify riding as safe or hazardous .
